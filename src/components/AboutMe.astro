      My name is Joel Faldín, also known as <span>Joelers</span>, and I'm 21 years old. I started programming 2 years ago, doing very basic HTML stuff. Today, I'm building <bold>full-stack applications</bold> turning ideas into reality.

    <p>
      I'm on my 4th year of college (they are 5 in total!), and I'm a collaborator of the <span>BlackSharkWeb</span> project! There, I helped my teammates with <bold>making requests from the frontend app to the backend server</bold>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy learning <span>Japanese</span>! 🍙🏯はじめまして！ (That means "Nice to meet you!")
